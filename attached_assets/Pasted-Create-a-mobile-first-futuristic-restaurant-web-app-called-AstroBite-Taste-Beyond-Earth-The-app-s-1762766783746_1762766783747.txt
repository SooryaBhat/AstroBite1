Create a mobile-first futuristic restaurant web app called AstroBite – Taste Beyond Earth.
The app should have a shared background image, a logo, and a dark/light mode toggle that also changes text colors.

Design Concept:

Theme: Space restaurant on Mars — clean, modern, glowing UI

Colors: deep black #0d0d0d, Mars red #b11226, neon orange #ff5c39, silver #e6e6e6

Fonts: “Orbitron” for headings, “Exo 2” for text (use Google Fonts)

Style: Glassmorphism (blurred translucent panels), glowing buttons, smooth transitions

App Structure (All pages share same background and navbar):

Home Page:

Centered large logo “AstroBite” and tagline “Taste Beyond Earth”

Under that, 3 big statistic boxes:

“25+ Unique Dishes”

“1000+ Happy Customers”

“Serving Since 2087”

Top-right corner: hamburger (☰) menu icon

Top-left corner: light/dark toggle (🌙/☀️)

Menu Page:

Sticky top search bar and filter button

“Recommended Menu” section (4–5 cards with image, title, price)

“Full Menu” section with scrollable dish list

About Page:

Title “About AstroBite”

Paragraph describing the story of the first restaurant on Mars and its futuristic mission

Gallery / Experience Page:

Grid of 6–8 photos or placeholder images

Below it, customer feedback cards (name + review + 5-star icons)

Contact / Reserve Page:

Contact details (phone, email, Mars base address)

Simple reservation form with fields: Name, Email, Date, Time, Guests

“Reserve Now” button with glow effect

Functionalities:

Responsive for all mobile screen sizes (max width ~480px).

Light/dark mode toggle saves preference with localStorage.

Hamburger menu slides open from right side with page links: Home, Menu, About, Gallery, Contact.

Smooth scroll between pages or single-page sections.

Reusable background image across all sections (space or Mars landscape).

UI Animations:

Buttons and cards slightly glow on hover/tap.

Smooth fade-in for sections on scroll.

Add simple transition between pages (fade or slide).

Tech Stack:

HTML5, CSS3 (no frameworks, pure responsive layout)

Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (menu toggle, theme toggle, localStorage).

Deliverables:

index.html, style.css, and script.js files.

Organized, commented, production-ready code.

Background image and logo placeholders included with descriptive filenames (mars-bg.jpg, astrobite-logo.png).

Make sure everything looks unique, high-quality, and futuristic — suitable for a competition demo.
